===== Description =====
The archive contains 6 samples of 1200 documents, balanced over the 6 labels (E21,CCAT,M11,GCAT,C15,ECAT). Each sample is made of 5 views (EN,FR,GR,IT,SP) on the same documents. The documents were initially in english, and the FR, GR, IT, and SP views corresponds to the words of their traductions respectively in French, German, Italian and Spanish.
