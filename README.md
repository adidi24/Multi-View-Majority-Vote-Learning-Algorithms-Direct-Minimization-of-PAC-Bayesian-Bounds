# Multi-View-Majority-Vote-Learning-Algorithms-Direct-Minimization-of-PAC-Bayesian-Bounds

This repo is the official implementation of ["Multi-View Majority Vote Learning Algorithms: Direct Minimization of PAC-Bayesian Bounds"](https://github.com/adidi24/Multi-View-Majority-Vote-Learning-Algorithms-Direct-Minimization-of-PAC-Bayesian-Bounds.git).

## Introduction

The implementation is provided as a module called `mvpb`, which offers an interface for implementing and optimizing PAC-Bayesian bounds specifically designed for multi-view learning.

## Acknowledgements

The `mvpb` package is slightly inspired from the implementation from <https://github.com/StephanLorenzen/MajorityVoteBounds.git>. we also took the immplementation of the *Deep Neural Decision Forests(dNDF)* in PyTorch from <https://github.com/jingxil/Neural-Decision-Forests.git> with minor modifications.
